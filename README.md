# Overview of the Project:

The problematic of this project was to provide real-time suggestions for a travel company client's ideal vacation based on locations temperature.<br>

We analysed and then visualized weather-data from OpenWeatherMap in three stages:<br>

- Collect the Data.
- Perform an exploratory Analysis with Visualization.
- Visualize travel data (GoogleMaps).<br>

# Results:

Users could use the application to enter their ideal vacation temperature and then picked up a place worldwide from it. Then they had access to the chosen city and got a suggestion of hotel to stay in a 5 miles radius from the picked city.<br>
They also got the maximum temperature as well as the current broadcast weather of the desire travel spot.<br>
Finally, users could build-up a vacation itinerary and access information about cities they would like to visit and visualized it on a map.
